Made by four collage students, *NotHorror* is far from a great game. It is however a _good_ game, and we hope you appreciate it. We put some work into it. It centers around a 3D platformer. The aim of the game is to get from one side of the platform to the other.
We *totally* didn't copy Super Mario. Honest.
